# Transport Module Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the `transport.rs` module to improve testability, maintainability, and adherence to Rust best practices. The current implementation relies heavily on global state and direct dependencies, making it difficult to test and maintain.

## Current Issues

- **Global Mutable State**: Uses `Lazy<Mutex<...>>` for shared state across the application *(Addressed in Phase 2)*
- **Direct Dependencies**: Hard-coded dependencies on network I/O and cryptographic implementations *(Addressed in Phase 2)*
- **Error Handling**: Uses `.expect()` which panics instead of proper error propagation *(✅ COMPLETED - Proper error handling implemented)*
- **Mixed Concerns**: Combines UI feedback, networking, and encryption logic *(Addressed in Phase 2)*
- **Limited Testability**: Difficult to unit test due to the architecture and global state *(✅ COMPLETED - Mock implementations and unit tests added)*

## Refactoring Objectives

1. Replace global state with dependency injection
2. Create abstractions for external dependencies (network, encryption)
3. Implement proper error handling with a custom error type
4. Separate concerns (networking, encryption, UI updates)
5. Improve testability with a modular design and mockable interfaces

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Define New Architecture (1-2 days)

1. **Create Core Data Structures**
   - `ConnectionConfig`: Configuration for connections
   - `MessageStore`: Container for messages
   - `Message`: Structured message type with metadata

2. **Define Key Interfaces**
   - `Transport`: Network communication abstraction
   - `EncryptionService`: Encryption operations abstraction
   - `ConnectionObserver`: UI notification abstraction

### Phase 2: Implement Core Components (2-3 days) *(✅ COMPLETED)*

1. **ConnectionManager** *(✅ COMPLETED)*
   - Main class orchestrating the connection
   - Manages state and dependencies

## Detailed Component Specifications

### 1. ConnectionManager

```rust
pub struct ConnectionManager {
    config: ConnectionConfig,
    status: ConnectionStatus,
    transport: Option<Box<dyn Transport>>,
    encryption: Option<Box<dyn EncryptionService>>,
    messages: MessageStore,
    observers: Vec<Box<dyn ConnectionObserver>>,
    cancel_token: CancellationToken,
}

impl ConnectionManager {
    pub fn new(config: ConnectionConfig) -> Self { ... }
    pub async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError> { ... }
    pub async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError> { ... }
    pub async fn send_message(&mut self, content: String) -> Result<(), TransportError> { ... }
    pub fn register_observer(&mut self, observer: Box<dyn ConnectionObserver>) { ... }
    // Other methods...
}
```

### 2. Transport Interface *(✅ COMPLETED)*

```rust
pub trait Transport: Send + Sync {
    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError>;  // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    async fn send(&mut self, data: &str) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
    async fn receive(&mut self) -> Result<Option<String>, TransportError>;
    async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
}
```

**✅ STATUS**: Transport trait completed with proper connect method integration. TcpTransport implements all methods correctly.

### 3. EncryptionService Interface *(✅ COMPLETED)*

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait EncryptionService: Send + Sync {
    fn encrypt(&self, key: &str, plaintext: &str) -> Result<String, EncryptionError>;
    fn decrypt(&self, key: &str, ciphertext: &str) -> Result<String, EncryptionError>;
    async fn perform_handshake(&mut self, transport: &mut dyn Transport) -> Result<(), TransportError>;
}
```

**✅ STATUS**: EncryptionService trait completed with X25519 key exchange handshake support. AesGcmEncryption implements secure key derivation from shared secrets.

### 4. ConnectionObserver Interface

```rust
pub trait ConnectionObserver: Send + Sync {
    fn on_status_change(&self, status: ConnectionStatus);
    fn on_message_received(&self, message: Message);
    fn on_message_sent(&self, message: Message);
    fn on_error(&self, error: TransportError);
}
```

### 5. Error Handling

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum TransportError {
    #[error("Connection error: {0}")]
    ConnectionError(#[from] std::io::Error),
    
    #[error("Encryption error: {0}")]
    EncryptionError(String),
    
    #[error("Authentication failed: {0}")]
    AuthenticationError(String),
    
    #[error("Protocol error: {0}")]
    ProtocolError(String),
    
    #[error("Timeout: operation took longer than {0}ms")]
    Timeout(u64),
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Core Components

- Test `ConnectionManager` with mock dependencies
- Test encryption/decryption functions
- Test message handling and state management

### Mock Implementations

```rust
struct MockTransport {
    connect_called: bool,
    send_data: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    receive_data: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
}

impl Transport for MockTransport {
    async fn connect(&mut self, _addr: SocketAddr) -> Result<(), TransportError> {
        self.connect_called = true;
        Ok(())
    }
    
    // Other methods...
}
```

### Test Scenarios

- Connection establishment and termination
- Message sending and receiving
- Error handling and recovery
- Race conditions and concurrency

## Migration Considerations

### Backward Compatibility

- Keep the original API working during transition
- Use feature flags to toggle between implementations
- Provide migration documentation

### Performance Impact

- Benchmark before and after refactoring
- Ensure no significant performance regressions
- Optimize critical paths if needed

### State Migration

- Plan for migrating existing connections
- Handle edge cases during transition
- Provide fallback mechanisms

## Potential Risks and Mitigation

    get_connection_status, migrate_connection
};

// Initialize with new architecture
init_with_new_architecture();

// Use the same API as before - automatically delegates to ConnectionManager
connect_client(input, address).await?;
let status = get_connection_status().await;
disconnect_client().await?;

// Environment variable support
// Set LAIR_CHAT_USE_NEW_TRANSPORT=true to enable new architecture
// Set LAIR_CHAT_USE_NEW_TRANSPORT=false to use legacy implementation
```

**Production Deployment Strategy:**
