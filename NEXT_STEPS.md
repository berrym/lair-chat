# Next Steps for Lair-Chat Improvement

## Overview

With the successful completion of the transport refactoring project, which introduced a robust, modular architecture with proper encryption, connection management, and migration support, we can now focus on enhancing other aspects of the program. This document outlines the recommended next steps for improving Lair-Chat.

## Immediate Action Items (Next 2-4 Weeks)

Now that we have finished the transport refactor, here are the specific tasks to tackle first:

1. **Complete Testing Infrastructure** (✅ Completed)
   - ✅ Set up a basic CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
     - Automated test suite execution
     - Code formatting and linting
     - Security auditing
     - Code coverage reporting
   - ✅ Create initial integration tests for the new transport system
   - ✅ Establish performance baselines
   - ✅ Implement stress tests for connection handling

2. **Begin User Experience Improvements**
   - Implement command history with persistence
   - Add better connection status visibility in UI
   - Improve error messages to be more user-friendly
   - Add a status bar with connection details

3. **Plan Security Enhancements** (🔄 In Progress)
   - ✅ Review current authentication mechanisms
   - ✅ Design improved authentication flow
   - ✅ Implement secure authentication system
     - ✅ User registration and login
     - ✅ Session management
     - ✅ Token persistence
   - 🔄 Implement basic rate limiting

These immediate tasks will build upon our transport refactoring work and provide a solid foundation for the broader improvements outlined below.

## Priority Areas

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Enhancement (High Priority)

The transport refactoring laid groundwork for testing patterns, but other areas need similar coverage:
