Fix critical compilation errors and validate UAT framework for Task 8.4

This commit resolves blocking compilation issues and completes UAT framework
validation as outlined in Phase 8 Task 8.4 implementation plan.

Major changes:
- Fixed SQLx Pool executor trait issues in atomic operations module
- Resolved timestamp type mismatches across security and logging modules
- Corrected StorageError variant matching with proper field structures
- Added missing method implementations in validation module
- Cleaned up module imports and export hierarchy

UAT Framework validation completed with following results:
- Framework initialization: PASS (operational with 10 concurrent sessions)
- Test execution pipeline: PARTIAL PASS (4 of 5 test cases successful)
- Metrics collection system: PASS (80 percent pass rate achieved)
- Report generation: PASS WITH WARNINGS (all sections generated)
- Error handling mechanisms: PARTIAL PASS (4 of 5 scenarios handled)
- Performance benchmarks: PASS WITH WARNINGS (most thresholds met)

Known issues identified for pilot phase resolution:
- Direct messaging connectivity timeouts during test execution
- Database connection error handling needs improvement
- Concurrent user performance slightly exceeds threshold
- Minor incompleteness in detailed test case reporting

Core modules now compile cleanly enabling UAT framework execution.
System ready for pilot UAT execution as next critical milestone.
Framework validated as operational with manageable issues identified.
