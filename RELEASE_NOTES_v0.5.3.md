# Lair Chat v0.5.3 Release Notes

## 🎯 **Critical Bug Fixes**

This release addresses two critical issues that were preventing proper functionality for multiple users and connection management.

### ✅ **Fixed: Login Screen Unresponsive After Disconnect**

**Issue**: After pressing 'd' to disconnect, the login page would appear automatically but was completely unresponsive to user input, including mode switching (Ctrl+T) and form interactions.

**Root Cause**: The login screen's `handle_auth_state()` method didn't properly handle `AuthState::Unauthenticated`, leaving the screen stuck in `processing` mode.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper state reset for `AuthState::Unauthenticated` case
- Login screen now properly resets `processing`, error states, and UI modes
- All user interactions now work correctly after disconnect

**Files Modified**: `src/client/components/auth/login.rs`

### ✅ **Fixed: Message Sending for Subsequent Users**

**Issue**: First registered user could send messages normally, but subsequent users (after disconnect/reconnect cycles) couldn't send messages at all.

**Root Cause**: ConnectionManager was reusing stale `AuthManager` and `token_storage` instances across disconnections, causing authentication state conflicts between different users.

**Solution**:
- Clear `auth_manager` and `token_storage` during disconnect
- Create new `CancellationToken` for each connection
- Ensure completely clean state for each new user session

**Files Modified**: `src/client/connection_manager.rs`

### ✅ **Previously Fixed: First Message Sending**

**Issue**: First message after registration/login wouldn't send due to race conditions.

**Solution**: Added 200ms stabilization delays after authentication success to ensure server-side processing completes before allowing message sending.

**Files Modified**: `src/client/app.rs`

## 🛠 **Technical Improvements**

### Connection State Management
- **Clean Disconnection**: ConnectionManager now properly resets all internal state
- **Fresh Sessions**: Each new connection gets completely clean authentication state
- **Reliable Reconnection**: Multiple disconnect/connect cycles now work consistently

### User Interface
- **Responsive Login**: Login screen remains fully functional after any disconnect
- **Consistent Behavior**: All key bindings work properly in all connection states
- **Mode Switching**: Ctrl+T toggle between login/register modes works reliably

## 📋 **Key Behaviors**

### Connection Keys
- **'c' key**: Connect/Reconnect (shows message if already connected)
- **F2 key**: Connect/Reconnect (same behavior as 'c')
- **'d' key**: Disconnect (now works properly and shows responsive login screen)

### Disconnect Behavior
- Disconnect automatically shows login page (responsive and functional)
- No restart required for reconnection
- All user interface elements work correctly after disconnect
- Clean state for new user sessions

### Multi-User Support
- First user registration/login: ✅ Working
- Subsequent users after disconnect: ✅ **FIXED** - Now working
- Message sending for all users: ✅ **FIXED** - Now working
- Multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles: ✅ **FIXED** - Now working

## 📝 **Development Notes**

This release focused on fixing critical state management issues that were preventing proper multi-user functionality. The fixes ensure that:

1. Each user session gets completely clean state
