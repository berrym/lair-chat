# Unread Messages Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Enhance the Lair Chat user experience by improving unread message indicators and notifications when messages arrive from conversations other than the currently viewed chat.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
1. **ConversationSummary unread tracking**: Each conversation tracks `unread_count`
2. **DM Navigation Panel indicators**: Shows "‚óè" for unread messages and count badges
3. **Title badges**: Navigation panel title shows total unread count like "Direct Messages (5)"
4. **Visual styling**: Unread conversations are bold and highlighted in red
5. **Mark as read functionality**: `mark_messages_read` API exists
6. **Total unread count tracking**: `get_total_unread_count` available

### ‚ùå Missing Features
1. **Global status bar indicator**: No system-wide unread count visible outside DM panel
2. **Cross-conversation notifications**: No alerts when viewing one chat and receiving messages in another
3. **Real-time updates**: Unread counts may not update in real-time across UI components
4. **Audio/visual notifications**: No sound or visual flash for new messages
5. **Desktop notifications**: No system notifications for background messages

## Enhancement Goals

### 1. Global Unread Message Indicator
**Problem**: Users can't see if they have unread DMs unless the DM navigation panel is open.
**Solution**: Add persistent unread count badge to main UI status bar.

### 2. Cross-Conversation Message Alerts  
**Problem**: When viewing a specific chat, users miss messages from other conversations.
**Solution**: Show temporary notification overlay when messages arrive from other chats.

### 3. Enhanced Tab/Chat View Indicators
**Problem**: Hard to see which conversations need attention in the navigation list.
**Solution**: Improve visual indicators and sorting by unread status.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Global Status Bar Enhancement (2-3 hours)

#### 1.1 Status Bar Unread Count
- Add unread message count to main status bar
- Show format: "üí¨ 3" or "DMs (3)" when unread messages exist
- Hide indicator when no unread messages
- Make clickable to open DM navigation panel

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/components/status/mod.rs` (if exists) or status bar component
- `src/client/components/home.rs` (status bar rendering)
- `src/client/app.rs` (global state management)

#### 1.2 Real-time Updates
- Ensure status bar updates immediately when messages arrive
- Connect to DirectMessageManager events
- Update count when conversations are marked as read

### Phase 2: Cross-Conversation Notifications (3-4 hours)

#### 2.1 Notification System
- Create notification overlay component
- Show temporary notifications for messages from other conversations
- Include sender name and message preview
- Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- Allow manual dismiss with Esc or click

**New files:**
- `src/client/components/notifications/message_notification.rs`
- `src/client/components/notifications/mod.rs`

#### 2.2 Smart Notification Logic
- Only show notifications when:
  - Currently viewing a different conversation OR
  - Currently in lobby/room chat mode
- Don't show notifications for currently active conversation
- Respect "muted" conversation settings

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visual Indicators (2-3 hours)

#### 3.1 Improved DM Navigation Panel
- Sort conversations by unread status (unread first)
- Add visual pulse/glow animation for new messages
- Show "NEW" badge for very recent messages (< 5 minutes)
- Improve color coding and contrast

**Files to modify:**
- `src/client/components/dm_navigation.rs`

#### 3.2 Chat Tab Indicators
- Add unread count next to conversation names
- Use different colors for different urgency levels:
  - Red: > 10 unread messages
  - Orange: 3-10 unread messages  
  - Blue: 1-2 unread messages
- Show last message timestamp

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional, 2-3 hours)

#### 4.1 Audio Notifications
- Add optional sound effects for new messages
- Different sounds for DMs vs room messages
- User preference to enable/disable sounds

#### 4.2 Desktop Notifications
- System tray notifications (if supported)
- Brief message preview in notification
- Click to focus application

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
```rust
// Global unread state in App
pub struct UnreadMessageState {
    pub total_dm_count: u32,
    pub conversation_counts: HashMap<ConversationId, u32>,
    pub last_notification_time: HashMap<ConversationId, u64>,
    pub notifications_enabled: bool,
    pub sound_enabled: bool,
}
```

### Event System  
```rust
// New events for unread message updates
pub enum UnreadMessageEvent {
    CountUpdated { conversation_id: ConversationId, new_count: u32 },
    NewMessageReceived { conversation_id: ConversationId, sender: String, preview: String },
    ConversationMarkedRead { conversation_id: ConversationId },
    GlobalCountChanged { total_count: u32 },
}
```

### Notification Component
```rust
// Temporary notification overlay
pub struct MessageNotification {
    pub id: uuid::Uuid,
    pub sender_name: String,
    pub message_preview: String,
    pub conversation_id: ConversationId,
    pub created_at: SystemTime,
    pub auto_dismiss_time: SystemTime,
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Status Bar Integration
1. Create `UnreadMessageState` in main App
2. Connect to DirectMessageManager events
3. Add unread count display to status bar
4. Test real-time updates

### Step 2: Notification Overlay
1. Create notification component
2. Add notification queue management
3. Implement auto-dismiss logic
4. Style notifications for good UX

### Step 3: Enhanced Navigation
1. Update DM navigation sorting
2. Add visual indicators and animations
3. Improve color scheme
4. Test with multiple conversations

### Step 4: Integration Testing
1. Test across all chat modes (lobby, DM, room)
2. Verify performance with many conversations
3. Test edge cases (offline, reconnection)
4. User acceptance testing

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User in Lobby, receives DM
1. Status bar shows "üí¨ 1"
2. Notification overlay appears: "Alice: Hey there!" (3 seconds)
3. DM navigation panel (if open) shows Alice's conversation with unread indicator

### Scenario 2: User in DM with Alice, receives message from Bob
1. Status bar updates to "üí¨ 1" 
2. Notification overlay: "Bob: Quick question..." (3 seconds)
3. DM navigation shows Bob's conversation moved to top with unread indicator
4. Alice's conversation remains active/focused

### Scenario 3: User opens DM navigation panel
1. Conversations sorted by: unread first, then by recent activity
2. Unread conversations show bold text + count badges
3. Visual pulse on newly arrived messages
4. Clear visual hierarchy

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] Users can see unread DM count without opening navigation panel
- [x] Users get notified of messages from other conversations
- [x] Unread indicators update in real-time
- [x] No performance impact on chat functionality

### Nice to Have
- [x] Audio notifications (user preference)
- [x] Desktop system notifications
- [x] Advanced visual effects (pulse, glow)
