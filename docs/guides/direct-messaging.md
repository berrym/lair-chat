# Direct Messaging User Guide

This guide explains how to use the direct messaging system in Lair Chat.

## Overview

The direct messaging (DM) system allows you to have private conversations with other users currently in the Lobby. All users automatically join the shared "Lobby" room when they connect, making them available for direct messaging. You can send text messages, share files, and manage your conversations efficiently.
