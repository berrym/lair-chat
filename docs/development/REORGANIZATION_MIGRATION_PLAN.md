# Lair-Chat Project Reorganization Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for reorganizing the lair-chat project structure to improve maintainability, scalability, and development experience. The migration will be performed in phases to ensure the project remains compilable and functional throughout the process.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure Issues
- Inconsistent module organization with manual `#[path]` attributes
- Duplicate module declarations between root and client `lib.rs`
- Transport-related files scattered at different levels
- Minimal server structure lacking core functionality
- No clear separation of shared code between client and server
- Mixed component organization patterns

### Migration Goals
1. Establish clear separation between client, server, and shared code
2. Create consistent module organization patterns
3. Improve code discoverability and maintainability
4. Enable better testing and documentation structure
5. Future-proof the architecture for extensibility

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Shared Code Extraction
**Objective**: Create the foundation for shared code and establish the common module structure.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/common/` directory structure
2. Move shared protocol definitions to `src/common/protocol/`
3. Move shared crypto utilities to `src/common/crypto/`
4. Move transport abstractions to `src/common/transport/`
5. Create shared error types in `src/common/errors/`
6. Update imports to use common modules
7. Ensure project compiles and tests pass

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Client Code Reorganization
**Objective**: Restructure client code into logical feature groups.

**Tasks**:
1. Create new client module structure
2. Move UI components to `src/client/ui/`
3. Reorganize authentication code in `src/client/auth/`
4. Consolidate chat functionality in `src/client/chat/`
5. Create network module for client networking
6. Establish storage module for client-side data
7. Move application logic to `src/client/app/`
8. Update all imports and module declarations
9. Ensure project compiles and tests pass

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Server Code Expansion and Organization
**Objective**: Expand server functionality and organize it properly.

**Tasks**:
1. Create comprehensive server module structure
2. Expand server authentication system
3. Create chat message handling modules
4. Implement server networking components
5. Establish server storage abstractions
6. Create server application logic
7. Update imports and ensure compilation
8. Verify server functionality

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Phase 4: Binary Reorganization and Module Cleanup
**Objective**: Clean up binary entry points and finalize module structure.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/bin/` directory
2. Move binary entry points to proper locations
3. Update `Cargo.toml` binary configurations
4. Clean up root `lib.rs` to properly expose public APIs
5. Remove redundant module declarations
6. Ensure all imports are correct and efficient
7. Final compilation and testing verification

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout
- Ensure all modules have proper documentation
- Follow Rust best practices for module organization
- Preserve existing functionality exactly
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Testing Strategy
- Run full test suite after each phase
- Verify compilation success after each major change
- Test both client and server functionality
- Run integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality
- Performance benchmarks should remain stable

### Git Commit Strategy
- Create meaningful commits for each logical change
- Use conventional commit messages
- Commit frequently to track progress
- Tag major phase completions
- Include detailed commit messages explaining changes

### Rollback Plan
- Each phase should be completable independently
- Maintain ability to rollback to previous phase
- Document any breaking changes
- Keep backup of original structure until migration complete

## Risk Mitigation
