# Test Plan for Lair Chat Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Disconnection After Registration
**Problem**: Newly registered users were getting disconnected after a few message sends
**Fix Applied**: 
- Increased authentication timeout from 5 seconds to 15 seconds
- Improved authentication message detection patterns
- Added comprehensive debug logging

**Test Steps**:
1. Start server: `cargo run --bin lair-chat-server`
2. Start client: `cargo run --bin lair-chat-client`
3. Register a new user (e.g., username: testuser, password: testpass)
4. Send multiple messages in quick succession
5. Verify user stays connected and messages are delivered

**Expected Result**: User should remain connected and be able to send/receive messages without disconnection

### 2. Messages Appearing "One Behind"
**Problem**: Displayed messages seemed to be one behind, likely due to scroll logic timing issues
**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced unsafe static scroll variables with proper struct fields
- Fixed scroll calculation to show the very latest message
- Improved message ordering with proper timing

**Test Steps**:
1. Connect two clients to the server
2. Send messages from client A
3. Observe messages on client B immediately
4. Send messages from client B
5. Observe messages on client A immediately
6. Test rapid message sending from both clients

**Expected Result**: Messages should appear immediately and in correct order without delay

### 3. Scroll Logic Issues
**Problem**: Unsafe static variables caused race conditions in scroll handling
**Fix Applied**:
- Moved scroll state to Home struct fields
- Fixed manual/auto scroll transitions
- Improved scroll boundary calculations

**Test Steps**:
1. Fill chat with many messages (send 20+ messages)
2. Use Page Up/Down to scroll through history
3. Use arrow keys to scroll line by line
4. Send a new message while scrolled up
5. Verify auto-scroll returns to bottom
6. Test End key to jump to bottom
7. Test Escape key to exit manual scroll mode

**Expected Result**: Smooth scrolling with proper auto-follow behavior

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Client connects successfully
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Messages send and receive properly
- [ ] Multiple users can chat simultaneously

### Connection Stability
- [ ] New users stay connected after registration
- [ ] Users can send multiple messages without disconnection
- [ ] Connection remains stable during rapid message sending
- [ ] Proper error messages on connection issues

### Message Display
- [ ] Messages appear immediately after sending
- [ ] Message order is correct
- [ ] No "one behind" behavior observed
- [ ] Proper formatting of sender names

### Scroll Behavior
- [ ] Auto-scroll follows new messages
- [ ] Manual scroll works with Page Up/Down
- [ ] Line-by-line scroll works with arrow keys
- [ ] Return to auto-scroll after manual scrolling
- [ ] Scroll indicators work properly
- [ ] No race conditions or crashes during scrolling

## Stress Testing

### High Message Volume
```bash
# Test rapid message sending
for i in {1..50}; do
  echo "Test message $i" | # send via client
  sleep 0.1
done
```

### Multiple Users
1. Start 3-5 client instances
2. Register different users
3. Send messages simultaneously from all clients
4. Verify all messages are received by all clients
5. Check for any disconnections or message loss

## Debug Logging

The following log messages should appear during testing:

**Authentication Success**:
```
INFO: User <username> authenticated successfully - transitioning to home mode
INFO: Chat system initialized successfully for <username>
INFO: Welcome messages added for user <username>
```

**Authentication Progress**:
```
INFO: Starting authentication response wait for user: <username>
INFO: Authentication wait progress: 3 seconds elapsed for user <username>
INFO: Authentication success detected for user: <username>
```

**Connection Issues**:
```
WARN: Cannot send message - client not connected: <message>
ERROR: Authentication timeout after 15 seconds for user: <username>
```

## Performance Verification

### Memory Usage
- Monitor for memory leaks during extended use
- Check scroll state doesn't accumulate indefinitely
- Verify message history doesn't grow unbounded

### CPU Usage
- Ensure smooth 60fps rendering
- No excessive CPU usage during scrolling
- Efficient message processing

## Known Limitations

1. Message history is not persistent (stored in memory only)
2. No message encryption end-to-end (only transport encryption)
3. Limited to single chat room
4. No user authentication persistence across restarts

## If Issues Persist

If any of the original issues still occur:

1. Check server logs for authentication timeouts
2. Verify client logs show proper state transitions
3. Test with single user first, then multiple users
4. Check network connectivity and firewall settings
5. Ensure server is fully started before connecting clients

## Success Criteria

All fixes are considered successful if:
- ✅ New users remain connected after registration
- ✅ Messages appear immediately in correct order
- ✅ Scroll behavior is smooth and predictable
- ✅ No crashes or race conditions occur during normal use
- ✅ Debug logging provides clear visibility into issues

## Compilation Status

✅ **Server compiles successfully** - Fixed borrow checker issues in authentication flow
✅ **Client compiles successfully** - Fixed scroll state race conditions and unsafe static variables
✅ **Both binaries run without errors** - Server starts on 127.0.0.1:8080, client connects properly

### Binary Names:
- Server: `cargo run --bin lair-chat-server`
- Client: `cargo run --bin lair-chat-client`
