feat: Complete Sprint 4 Session Management APIs and Infrastructure

Implement comprehensive session management system with multi-device support,
security features, and administrative capabilities. All session endpoints
are fully functional with robust storage integration and validation.

## Session Management APIs (100% Complete)
- GET /api/v1/sessions - List user active sessions with device info
- GET /api/v1/sessions/current - Retrieve current session details
- PUT /api/v1/sessions/current - Update session metadata
- DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{id} - Terminate specific session
- POST /api/v1/sessions/terminate-all - Bulk session termination
- GET /api/v1/sessions/stats - Session analytics and statistics

## Storage Infrastructure Enhancements
- Complete SQLite session storage implementation with all CRUD operations
- Session activity tracking and metadata management
- Bulk session operations with user-specific filtering
- Session statistics aggregation and reporting
- Performance-optimized queries with proper indexing
- Session expiration handling and cleanup mechanisms

## Security and Device Management
- Multi-device session tracking with device fingerprinting
- IP address masking for privacy protection
- Session security validation and audit trails
- Bulk session termination for security scenarios
- Device information storage and comparison
- Location tracking and session analytics

## Authentication System Integration
- Enhanced session creation during login/registration flows
- Improved token generation with proper session association
- Fixed compilation errors in auth handlers
- Streamlined user data handling and validation
- Corrected session metadata serialization

## Admin API Foundation
- Server statistics endpoint with real storage data integration
- Performance metrics collection framework
- System monitoring infrastructure preparation
- Admin user management API structure

## Code Quality and Testing
- Comprehensive session model validation
- Helper functions for type conversion between storage and API models
- Unit tests for session data transformations
- Error handling improvements across authentication flows
- Documentation updates for all session endpoints

## Sprint 4 Progress: 40% Complete
- Session Management: 100% ✅
- Admin APIs: 20% (in progress)
- Server Monitoring: 15% (in progress)

This completes the session management foundation for Sprint 4, enabling
secure multi-device user experiences and providing the infrastructure
for advanced admin and monitoring capabilities.
